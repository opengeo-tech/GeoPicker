Geospatial dataset picker via fast Api Rest interface written in [NodeJs for GDAL](https://github.com/mmomtchev/node-gdal-async) bindings and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)

- [Online Demo Map](https://opengeo.tech/geopicker)

- [Swagger API](https://opengeo.tech/geopicker/docs)

- [Article about this project](https://stefcud.medium.com/geopicker-bf4c4321c9ec)

## Scope

It is basically an advanced **elevation service** and Geopicker has been specially designed to offer the widest range of formats and methods of data requests that is possible, to adapt to any context of use by the client.
Each endpoint and the parameters it accepts have been designed on the basis of the functioning of already existing services, gathering a complete and coherent collection of APIs.
At present the index.html page contains a large implementation of browser side requests using LeafletJs as basemap and jQuery.

## Features
- **Large API Rest**: ergonomic endpoints suitable for any type of use case
- **Validation**: full validation of endpoint and parameters via **JSON-Schema** which allows output optimization
- **Configuration**: friendly configs and to help devs in many deployment contexts
- **Formats**: support for different geospatial input and output formats
- **Compression**: configurable output compression if client accept encoding: deflate,gzip

and includes some other additional functions:

- **Densify**: add more interpolated points in input coordinates, this improves the display on an elevation graph, adding intermediate positions at a minimum fixed distance.
- **Simplify**: unlike densify it removes points that are too close together from coordinates.
- **Precision**: alter the coordinates precision digits to lossily reduce the size of a geometry.
- **Height**: add the vertical distance from the ground, if input has elevation add a fourth coordinate with this value.
- **Metadata**: get on the fly metadata informations for a geometry (ex. length, direction, bbox, centroid, middlepoint)

## API Rest endpoints

The [API](https://opengeo.tech/geopicker/docs) is work in progress.
This basic structure can be extended starting from the environment variable `PREFIX` which by default `/`

### Global Parameters

|Status|Parameter | Default  | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
|  ✔️   | precision| `input`  | rounded to digits decimal precision |
|  ✔️   | format   | `input`  | output format conversion |
|  ✔️   | densify  | `input`  | enable densification of points in the result |
|  ✔️   | simplify | `input`  | enable simplication geometry of the result |
|  ❌  | height   | false    | add vertical distance from the ground(only input has elevation) |

Some behaviors to know about parameters are that:

- `precision` and `densify` parameters is only supported by endpoints and formats that return coordinates
- `datasetId` can have the value `default` to referring the main dataset defined in config
- from version v1.6.1 `/<datasetId>/...` is the same of `/datasets/<datasetId>/...` `/datasets/` is implicit.

### Formats

If the `format` parameter is not specified the default behavior is to output the same format as the input

- **input** format can be specified by `Content-type:` header in request
- **output** format can be specified by `format` parameter

the support for various input and output formats is summarized in the table

| Value     | In |Out | Description |
|-----------|----|----|-------------|
| `input`   | ✔️ | ✔️ | means the same format as the input data |
| `array`   | ✔️ | 🚧 | each location is `Array` and a Z dimension as value `[lon,lat,val]` |
| `json`    | ✔️ | 🚧 | each location is `Object` having `lon`,`lat` and `val` attributes   |
| `geojson` | ✔️ | 🚧 | standard GeoJSON objects `Feature`, `Geometry` with a Z dimension in `coordinates` as value |
| `polyline`| 🚧 | ✔️ | [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) |
| `gpx`     | 🚧 | ✔️ | GPS eXchange Format is an XML textual format |
| `csv`     | ❌ | ❌ | Comma-separated values is an textual format  |
| `kml`     | ❌ | ❌ | Keyhole Markup Language is an XML format for Google Earth|

each endpoint has its own default format, for example endpoint `/dataset/lon/lat` return a simple array of one value.


# Usage

Running by official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stefcud/geopicker):

```bash
docker run -v "/$(pwd)/tests/data:/data" -e DEMO_PAGE=true -p 9090:9090 stefcud/geopicker
```

Running from source code in development mode, requirements: _nodejs 16.x_ > and _glibc 2.28_ (_Ubuntu 20.x_ > ):

```bash
npm install
cd server && npm install && cd -
npm run dev
```
Browse the demo page: http://localhost:9090/

## Configuration

Full configuration options can be found in [docs config](./docs/config.md)

## Development

some useful tools for contributors `npm run <scriptname>`

- `start` run in production mode
- `dev` run in development mode
- `docker-up` run in local docker-compose container
- `bench` run benchmarks
- `npm publish .` build and publish new docker image


# Requests Example

Get single location exchanging a few bytes:
```bash
 $ curl "http://localhost:9090/default/11.123/46.123"

[195]
```

```bash
$ curl "http://localhost:9090/default/11.123/46.123?format=gpx"
```
output is a waypoint in GPX format:

```xml
<gpx version="1.1" creator="Geopicker">
<metadata/>
<wpt lat="46.123" lon="11.123">
<name/>
<desc/>
<ele>400</ele>
</wpt>
</gpx>
```

Post a json object and receive the same decorated with the result(still works with `longitude`,`latitude`):
```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{"lon": 11.123, "lat": 46.123"}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "http://localhost:9090/elevation/lonlat"

{"lon": 11.123,"lat": 46.123,"val":195}
```

Get many stringified locations in one time(designed for not too long LineString):
```bash
curl "http://localhost:9090/elevation/11.1,46.1|11.2,46.2|11.3,46.3"

[195,1149,1051]
```

Post a very long LineString saving bytes:
```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '[[10.9998,46.0064],[10.9998,46.0065],[10.9999,46.0066],[11.0000,46.0067]]' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "http://localhost:9090/elevation/locations"

[[10.9998,46.0064,900],[10.9998,46.0065,898],[10.9999,46.0066,898],[11.0000,46.0067,900]]
```

Post anyone GeoJSON geometry, the same input geometry is always returned which has a third dimension:
```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[11.1,46.1],[11.2,46.2],[11.3,46.3]]}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "http://localhost:9090/elevation/geometry"

{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[11.1,46.1,195],[11.2,46.2,1149],[11.3,46.3,1051]]}
```

Post a GeoJSON geometry of 2 points and Densify the linestring adding point each 400 meters,
this will help you build a less angular elevation graph:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[11,46],[11.01,46.01]]}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "http://localhost:9090/elevation/geometry?densify=400&precision=5"
```

output contains 3 additional interpolated locations with reduced precision digits:

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {
        "type": "LineString",
        "coordinates": [
          [11, 46, 897],
          [11.003, 46.003, 968],
          [11.006, 46.006, 1029],
          [11.009, 46.009, 1122],
          [11.01, 46.01, 1187]
        ]
    }
}
```

Get the elevation value between two locations every 100 meters

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9090/elevation/11,46|11.01,46.01?densify=100"

[925,858,909,963,968,1001,1018,997,1025,1062,1064,1102,1115,1163,1187]
```
